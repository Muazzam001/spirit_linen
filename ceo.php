                    <p>Moshe Faour, son of founding owner Sammy Faour, officially started his career in the industry at 20 years old. Unofficially, though, he's been a part of the business since he was very young, going into work with his father during summer and winter vacations.
 At Spirit Linen, Moshe's first year in the office was spent shadowing his father, and the operation learning the ins and outs of the business. By year two, Moshe was already in charge of day to day operations of the warehouse. After only a few years of excellence and growth, he was promoted to lead the company as the CEO and face of Spirit Linen for years to come.
 Through his young leadership the company is in great hands for years of growth, innovation and complete excellence.</p>
